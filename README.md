# PBTest_AutoSemantic

## Overview

Repository for learning and testing automatic semantic versioning with go-semantic-release.

### Repositories

- **[PBTest_AutoSemantic](https://github.com/MTBonde/PBTest_AutoSemantic)** (this repo): Learn automatic semantic versioning with go-semantic-release
- **[PBTest_GitOps](https://github.com/MTBonde/PBTest_GitOps)**: Learn GitOps workflows and environment promotion
- **[PBTest_Infra](https://github.com/MTBonde/PBTest_Infra)**: Learn Infrastructure as Code with Terraform 
## How I'm Using This Repository

This README.md file serves as my **learning journal**. As I work through each step, I'll document:
- What I did in each step
- The commit message I used
- Expected vs. actual results
- What I learned from each step

Each commit to this README will test different commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.) and demonstrate how semantic versioning works in practice.

## My Learning Journey

### Step 1.1: Initial Workflow Setup
**What I did**: Created GitHub Actions workflow for go-semantic-release
**Commit**:
```
git commit -m "ci: add go-semantic-release workflow"
```

**Expected result**:
- Workflow runs successfully
- No release created (ci: commits don't trigger releases)
- Workflow visible in GitHub Actions tab

**Actual result**:
_[To be filled after pushing and checking GitHub Actions]_
